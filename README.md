# lispi
A basic lisp interpreter, written for fun, with no promises of accuracy or quality.
Very much a work in progress at this point. Lisp has about a billion dialetcs, I am probably
going to stick relatively closely to MIT Scheme, because it has good documentation and is what
I am familiar with.
